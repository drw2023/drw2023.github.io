    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        The 15th Dewald Roode Workshop on Information Systems Security Research will continue the efforts to advance the discipline of information systems security through the creation, dissemination, and preservation of well-formed research, following the success of the first thirteen Information Systems Security Research Workshops (University of Cape Town, 2009; Bentley University, 2010; Virginia Tech, 2011; Brigham Young University, 2012; University at Buffalo, 2013; Newcastle University, 2014; University of Delaware, 2015; University of New Mexico, 2016; University of South Florida, 2017; University of Cape Town, 2018; Louisiana Tech University, 2019; Iowa State University, 2020; University of Texas at San Antonio, 2021; University of Colorado Denver, 2022).
    </p>
    <p>
        The active discussions in the workshop are intended to provide participants with specific and actionable feedback on their research. We anticipate that this process will facilitate the successful development of workshop papers for further consideration in important journals (See <a href="https://ifip.byu.edu/">https://ifip.byu.edu/</a> for past DRW papers which have been published in journals). High-quality papers will be fast-tracked to the <i>AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction</i>. Selection for the workshop is competitive, and only authors of the accepted papers and the active working group members will be invited to participate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anchoring the workshop to information systems means that the research will attend to and extend the social, organizational, and managerial literature in the focal area. <i>Note that this is not an appropriate venue for papers with a purely technical, design-science, or econometric approach</i>. While we assume an effective foundation in information security technology, we regard information systems risk broadly, for example, computer crime, employee misconduct, cyber warfare, cyber terrorism, human error and/or accident, natural events, etc. We also address information systems security broadly, for example, policies and policy compliance, diverse security behaviors, privacy, awareness, strategy, audit, planning, and control. These and related research topics will be the focus of this workshop.
    </p>
    <h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
    <p>
        The Dewald Roode Workshop on Information Systems Security Research topics may include (but are not limited to):

        Manuscripts will be prescreened by the program chairs to ensure that all papers sent to reviewers are reasonably complete, well-formed, and appropriate to the scope and mission of the workshop. Double- blind reviews will follow for prescreened papers. Authors can submit the manuscripts as “early stage” or “completed papers”.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Manuscripts must be anonymous for the review process</i>.  In recognition that the review process greatly relies upon a scarce resource of the services of reviewers, authors, <i>by the act of submission, are implicitly promising to serve as a reviewer on one to two conference papers, if requested</i>.
