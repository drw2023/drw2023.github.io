    <h2>Flight Advice</h2>
         
If you plan to drive around Scotland before or after DRW, it would be best to get a car at the airport. If you search for car rental
via Google Maps they will direct you to rental places on the other side of the Clyde River - which might be ok if there was an easy way of 
getting across the river, but it's quite a distance. 
    <p>
        Two car rentals to consider in <a href="https://www.rentalcars.com/en/airport/gb/gla/">Glasgow</a> are Arnold Clark (there is a shuttle from the airport) and Enterprise  (walking distance from the airport)  
   <br>
        <a href="https://www.rentalcars.com/en/airport/gb/edi/">
            Edinburgh Airport</a>
   <p>
       Please bear in mind that Scotland's alcohol limit for driving is very close to zero. This means that even a beer will put
       you over the legal limit. The police regularly stop vehicles and will always breathalise, especially in the evenings. 
       <p>
          Also - there are strict laws around carrying knives. If you have a pocket knife with a blade longer than 3cm it
           would be best not to carry it on your person. 
       
    <h2>Travel Guide</h2>
    
    It is probably easier and cheaper to fly directly to Edinburgh. From both airports, you have two options for getting to the venue:
    <p><ol>
    <li> Public Transport from Edinburgh Airport:<br>
        <ul>
       <li> Take the tram from the airport to Haymarket Station. <br>
        <li> Catch the train to Helensburgh<br>
     <li> Get a taxi to Rosslea Hotel (just outside the station)<br>
        </ul>
        You might want to install the trainline app so you can check the schedule on the day<br>
        <img width="150" src="trainline.png">
        <p>
             <li> Public Transport from Glasgow Airport:<br>
        <ul>
       <li> Take the bus from the airport to Queen Street Station (buy a return ticket). <br>
        <li> Catch the train to Helensburgh<br>
     <li> Get a taxi to Rosslea Hotel (just outside the station)<br>
        </ul>
                 <p>
          <li> Drive:<br>
            Rent a car at the airport and drive. It would be a good idea to book this in advance, especially in June. Ask for automatic,
              because if you don't you will get a stick shift and have to prove that you are licensed to drive one. <br>
            Try to avoid driving during rush hour (before 9am and between 4pm and 6pm)
            </ol>

    <p>
        The workshop will be held at the Rosslea Hall Hotel. Set in landscaped gardens, overlooking the Firth of Clyde in the picturesque village of Rhu – close to Helensburgh – Rosslea Hall is a charming hotel with a stunning seafront setting.

        Driving directions:
        <br>
        From Glasgow – travel westbound on the M8, exit at Junction 30 onto the M898. Travel over Erskine Bridge and take the exit for Crianlarich onto the A82 to Dumbarton. At the junction with the A814, turn left and at the roundabout follow signs for Helensburgh. Continue on the A814 for a further 10 miles. Continue along the water front, following the road and you will come to Ferry Road and the hotel is on the left hand side.

                 <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
                 This is a good idea - the National Health Service is struggling at the moment.
                 
                 
                <h2>Electrical Devices</h2>
                 Our electricity is 230 volts, so be careful. Some of your devices might not work very well. Bring along an adaptor.
                 We use a three (flat) pin plug.
